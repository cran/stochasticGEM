Description: stochasticGEM is a publicly available package that
    implements Bayesian inference for partially observed stochastic
    epidemics. The general epidemic model is used for estimating
    the parameters governing the infectious and incubation period length,
    and the parameters governing susceptibility. In real-life epidemics
    the infection process is unobserved, and the data consists of the
    times individuals are detected, usually via appearance of symptoms.
    The stochasticGEM package fits several variants of the general
    epidemic model, namely the stochastic SIR with Markovian and
    nonMarkovian infectious periods. The estimation is based on Markov chain
    Monte Carlo algorithm.
